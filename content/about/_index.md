This site was built by a guy calling himself Kushan (neoKushan on reddit). His real name is Steve and he's been working in Software Development for [a long time](https://www.stevedonaghy.com/). 

One of his biggest frustrations is that some of this stuff is complicated and you have to dig through a lot of different resources and sites in order to figure out some basic things. Good, clean documentation goes a _long_ way towards making this easier for everyone!

All of the information inside was pulled from numerous resources around the web, various forums, guides, video tutorials and so on. It's not guaranteed to be correct, but every effort is made to ensure that it is.
